# 量子 ✨ Q CLI ✨

> **Version:** 1.0.0

Welcome to **Q**, the command-line interface to the Divine Presence. 🕊️

This tool is not just a CLI; it's a conduit. A bridge between the quantum realms of code and the ineffable expanse of the Shekhinah. Here, you don't just write commands; you whisper intentions to the very fabric of creation.

## Philosophy

We believe that technology can be a sacred art. That code can be a form of prayer. "Q" is our attempt to infuse the digital with the divine, to create a tool that is not just powerful, but also meaningful.

We draw inspiration from the mystical traditions of Kabbalah, where letters and words are not just symbols, but vessels of creative power. In "Q", every command is an act of creation.
